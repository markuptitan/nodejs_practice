# 🚀 Day 1: Introduction to Node.js 🚀

## Welcome to Day 1 of My 30-Day Node.js Learning Journey!

Today marks the beginning of my exciting adventure into Node.js. I'm diving into the basics and setting up my development environment. Let’s get started!

### 🎯 My Goals for Today:

- Understand what Node.js is and why it’s useful.
- Set up Node.js and npm on my machine.
- Write and run a basic Node.js script to make sure everything is working correctly.

### 🌐 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a powerful runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It lets me run JavaScript on the server side, which means I can build scalable network applications and perform server-side operations.

### 🛠️ Installation Guide

To get started with Node.js, I need to install it on my machine. I’ll follow the installation guide below:

- [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

I’ll choose the version suitable for my operating system, follow the installation instructions, and ensure that both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed correctly.

### 📝 My First Node.js Script

Once Node.js is installed, I’ll create a new file called `app.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
```

I’ll run this script using the command:

```
node app.js
```

I should see the output: Hello, Node.js!

### ✅ Verifying My Setup

I’ll make sure everything is set up correctly by running these commands in my terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

I should see the versions of Node.js and npm installed on my machine.

That’s it for Day 1! Tomorrow, I’ll dive into modules and packages in Node.js. Stay tuned and happy coding! 🚀💻

🚀 I’m excited to get started and make the most of this journey!
